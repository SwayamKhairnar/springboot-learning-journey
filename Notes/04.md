CRUD operations and
JPA with H2 Database

First i implemented the whole thing using Normal Crup operations and Stream API's which worked too

But there are some other options too
1) use JDBC (TOOO lengthy but at low level best)
2) Use ORM like JVA or hybernate but cant switch in between
3) Use Spring data JPA(thats what we used easier for smaller projects but hard to debug tho !!)

JPA is used to map Java objects to database tables. It helps avoid writing repetitive SQL queries for basic database operations. Hibernate is commonly used as the JPA implementation.

I used annotations such as `@Entity`, `@Id`, and `@GeneratedValue` to define database entities and primary keys.

H2 is a lightweight in-memory database that is useful for learning and testing. It does not require any external setup and resets data when the application restarts.

Configuration was done in `application.properties` using datasource URL and Hibernate settings. The H2 console was enabled to inspect tables and data.

What I understood:
- JPA abstracts database interactions effectively
- H2 allows quick experimentation without installing a database
