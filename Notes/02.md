Spring vs Spring Boot

Spring framework requires a lot of configuration before an application can run. This configuration can be done using XML or Java-based configuration classes, which makes the initial setup time-consuming.

Spring Boot is built on top of Spring and aims to simplify this process. It provides auto-configuration and default setups, allowing applications to start with minimal configuration. It also comes with an embedded server, so external server setup is not required.

Key differences I noticed:
- Spring Boot reduces boilerplate code
- XML configuration is mostly unnecessary(Tooooooo boring T_T)
- Project setup is much faster in Spring Boot

What I understood:
- Spring Boot does not replace Spring
- It simplifies development while still using Spring internally
