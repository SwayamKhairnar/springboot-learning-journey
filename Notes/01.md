Dependency Injection (DI) & Inversion of Control (IoC)

Inversion of Control means that the responsibility of creating and managing objects is moved from the application code to the Spring framework. Instead of using `new`, Spring decides when and how objects are created.

Dependency Injection is the way Spring provides required objects to a class. Rather than a class creating its own dependencies, Spring injects them automatically at runtime. This helps reduce tight coupling between classes.

Types of dependency injection I worked with:
- Constructor injection (clean and preferred)
- Setter injection (useful for optional dependencies)
- Field injection (works but generally avoided)

Annotations I used during implementation:
- `@Component`
- `@Autowired`
- `@Configuration`
- `@Bean`

What I understood:
- IoC removes manual object management from the developer
- Constructor injection makes dependencies clear and safer
