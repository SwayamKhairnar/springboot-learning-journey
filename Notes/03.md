Layered Architecture (Controller – Service – Repository)

The controller layer handles incoming HTTP requests and maps them to appropriate methods. It should only deal with request and response handling and not business logic.

The service layer contains the core business logic of the application. It acts as a middle layer between the controller and repository and helps keep the code organized.

The repository layer is responsible for interacting with the database. It uses Spring Data JPA to perform database operations and should not contain any business logic.

Why this architecture is useful:
- Keeps responsibilities separated
- Makes code easier to read and maintain
- Simplifies testing of individual layers

What I understood:
- Business logic should not be written in controllers
- Proper layering leads to cleaner and scalable code
